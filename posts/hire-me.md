# Let's work together ðŸ’ª

Here are some of the things I can help you and your team with:

*   ## Good old fashioned software engineering

    Building a v1.0, getting an MVP out the door, adding new features to an existing app. I am a good collaborator when it comes to working with PMs and designers, as well as other engineers.  
    I'm focused on iOS software development in Swift and Objective-C. Lately I've gained more experience in Javascript and ReactNative, so don't hesitate pinging me about them as well.

*   ## Code and architecture review

    Do you have an existing app an a team of developers working on it. I can help identify archetectural bottle necks that prevent your team from moving fast.  
    I can also review your teams newly written code and give instant feedback. There's no better way for an engineer to grow than by providing them instant feedback on their work.

*   ## Workshops and Talks

    Tap my [years of experience](/experienced) in the field, working successfully in different settings from small startups to the scale of Facebook. Learn from the wins and failures I've seen me and others do over time. Let me suggest workflows and improvements to help your project excel.

Interested in talking? I'm always [up for a meeting ðŸ“†](mailto:hi@ullrich.is?subject=Let's%20chat&amp;body=Hi%20Ullrich%20ðŸ‘‹%0D%0A%0D) or to jump on the [phone ðŸ“±](tel:+491706164411).
