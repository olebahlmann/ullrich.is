        Here are some of the things I can help you and your team with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h2>Good old software engineering</h2>
          <p>
            Building a v1.0, getting an MVP out the door, adding new features to an existing app. I am a good colaborator when it comes to working with PMs and designers, as well as other engineers.<br />
            I'm focused on iOS software development in Swift and Objective-C. Lately I've gained more experience in Javascript and ReactNative, so don't hesitate pinging me about them as well.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Code and architecture review</h2>
          <p>
            Do you have an existing app an a team of developers working on it. I can help identify archetectural bottle necks that prevent your team from moving fast.<br/>
            I can also review your teams newly written code and give instant feedback. There's no better way for an engineer to grow than by providing them instant feedback on their work.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Workshops and Talks</h2>
